# Twilight UI
A dark theme for Foundry VTT. It adds some padding to pretty much everything, a Legend Keeper style journal, better folders, and replaces the spell level selection dropdown menu with buttons. It has been tested with the DnD 5e system, and I recommend you use the tidy5e sheet (in dark mode) with it. If you have any feedback, please feel free to message on Discord @Rayuaz (formerly Sua mãe, Aquela Católica#2512).

# ⚠️ Compatibility warning!!!
This mod doesn't work with any Foundry version after 8.x! I'm working on a complete rework of this mod, compatible with the current Foundry version, that wil be released soon™.

The whole thing is inspired by the [Legend Keeper](https://www.legendkeeper.com/)'s UI. The journal mimics pretty much 1:1 the logend Keeper interface.
